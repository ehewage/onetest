  "body": "### Welcome to OneTest Diagnostics\r\nOneTest Diagnostics is a Cambridge-based biotech startup developing a novel method of tracking response to therapy in colorectal cancer with the option to further develop the product for monitoring a wide range of cancers. Despite recent advances in cancer therapy, the most widely prescribed treatments are still incredibly toxic. Our point-of-care diagnostic device monitors the proportion of tumour DNA (ctDNA) in a patient's blood to determine how a patient is responding to therapy. OneTest’s novel technology removes the month-long wait associated with tracking this ctDNA and allows clinicians to longitudinally monitor treatment response in near real-time, leading to rapid decision making on choice of therapy. Better monitoring of cancer increases patients’ well-being and chances of surviving the disease. Our team of highly qualified scientists and engineers is working on a solution to realise that goal.\r\n\r\n### Contact Us\r\nEmail: diagnostics [at] cambridgeapplied [dot] co [dot] uk",
